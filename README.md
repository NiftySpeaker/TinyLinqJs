# TinyLinqJs
Ever wanted to use .NET Linq methods with your array's in your JavaScript methods? Now you can. Just embed TinyLinqJs in your HTML Pages and you can use the Linq-to-Objects extension methodes with your standard JavaScript array's, as they were .NET Enumerables.

How does this work? Just take a look in the Demos folder of the projct and view the examples in there.
If you are familiar with Linq-to-Objects and you like Linq, then here is a good point to start.

One big advantage of TinyLinqJs is, as the name says, that in the minified version it's just about 9 kB in size. This is very small if you can get the power of Linq into your JavaScripts. 

So, i hope you enjoy it! :D
